# cpp-brainfuck-interpreter
a brainfuck interpreter written in C++, made as part of my project to make a brainfuck-equivalent language.
You can feel free to modify the code for your own use (just make sure to credit me for my code)!
Feedback is welcome, I'm always looking to improve! (suggestions for a better name would also be highly appreciated)
